The best way to demonstrate my approach to work is to show it on my own example. My website is not just a business card. It's a living project that embodies the same principles I apply to my clients' products: performance, reliability, and attention to detail.

Let me give you a "behind-the-scenes" tour and explain why it’s built this way.

## Objective: To Create a System, Not Just a Website

My task wasn't just to build a few pages, but to create a scalable platform that solves several key objectives:

*   **Demonstrating expertise:** The site must clearly showcase my technical skills and development approach.
*   **Attracting clients:** It needs to be SEO-optimized, fast, and convert visitors into customers through user-friendly contact forms.
*   **Convenient content management:** The process of adding new portfolio projects and blog posts should be as simple and fast as possible.
*   **Stability and security:** The site must be securely protected and operate without failures.

## Solution: Choosing the Right Tools

To achieve these goals, I chose a modern and high-performance technology stack where every component has its place.

### 1. The Foundation — Astro.js

The site is built on the Astro framework. Why Astro? It's a champion of loading speed. It generates static HTML wherever possible and only adds JavaScript for interactive components. As a result, users get content instantly, which is crucial for retaining attention and for search engines.

**Hybrid Rendering:** The homepage, blog, and portfolio are all pre-built static pages. The contact forms, however, work via server-side API endpoints. This offers the best of both worlds: the speed of static sites and the power of a server.

**Content Collections:** All blog articles and portfolio projects are stored as simple Markdown files. This allows adding new content as easily as writing a text document, without needing to touch the code or use a complex CMS.

### 2. Internationalization (i18n)

The site was designed for an international audience from the ground up, supporting both Russian and English. The URL structure (`/ru/...`, `/en/...`) and translation system make it easy to add new languages in the future.

### 3. Geo-targeting for Local SEO

You may have noticed that the site has pages targeting specific cities (Minsk, Moscow, Berlin, etc.). This is intentional. These pages (`/en/services/[city]`) are designed to improve search engine visibility for local queries, helping to attract clients from different regions.

### 4. DevOps and Containerization with Docker

To ensure the site runs stably and is easy to deploy, the entire project is packaged into a Docker container.

**Isolation and Reproducibility:** It doesn’t matter where the site is run—on my laptop or a cloud server—the environment will always be identical. This eliminates problems like "but it worked on my machine."

**Security and Optimization:** A multi-stage build is used. The first stage installs all the tools needed to build the project, while the final, lightweight image contains only the finished application. This reduces the size and enhances security.

**CI/CD — Automated Deployment:** The site update process is fully automated. When I add a new article or make code changes and push them to the Git repository, the system automatically rebuilds the project and deploys the updates to the server.

### 5. Integrations and API

The site is not just a collection of pages but a communication tool.

**Contact and Brief Forms:** All forms (`/contact`, `/brief`) send data to a server-side API endpoint.

**Telegram Notifications:** After a form is submitted, the server-side logic instantly formats a message and sends it to me via Telegram. This allows me to respond to new inquiries within minutes.

## Result: The Website as a Reflection of a Philosophy

Ultimately, avpdev.com is more than just a portfolio. It is a working demonstration of my approach:

*   **Performance-first:** Fast loading times thanks to Astro.
*   **Reliable Architecture:** A well-thought-out structure ready for growth.
*   **Automation:** CI/CD and integrations save time and prevent errors.
*   **Attention to Detail:** From responsive design and theme switching to clean, typed TypeScript code.

This project proves that a modern website is not a collection of plugins but a single, carefully engineered organism where every element serves a common purpose. This is the exact approach I apply to my clients' projects.
