For a small company with **10–20 employees**, a CRM system should be a sharp scalpel, not a Swiss Army knife where 90% of the tools are never opened. While large corporations spend tens of thousands of dollars maintaining overloaded monsters like Salesforce, a small business can gain an edge through the speed and clarity of its own tools.

Let’s break down the numbers to see how custom development using **Next.js 15+** and **Python** allows a small team to save budget and work more efficiently than the giants.

## 1. Direct Savings: SaaS vs. Your Asset

For a team of **20 people**, subscriptions to popular services become a significant expense:

* **amoCRM:** On the "Advanced" plan (**$16/mo** per user), you pay **$320/mo** or **$3,840 per year**. On the "Enterprise" plan (**$22/mo**), it’s **$5,280 per year**.
* **Bitrix24:** The "Standard" plan for such a team costs **$75/mo** ($900 per year), but you get hundreds of buttons and features that only confuse employees and slow down work.

**Your Alternative:**
A custom CRM is your asset.
* **Hosting:** Modern, high-performance VPS starts at **$10/mo**.
* **Own Server:** **$0/mo** if hosted on the company's own hardware.

Unlike large companies that pay a fortune for CRM, you keep these **$3,000–$5,000 per year** inside your business.

## 2. "Nothing Extra": A UI That Helps, Not Hinders

The main problem with mass-market CRMs is that they are made for everyone at once. A small business manager is forced to wade through dozens of fields and tabs just to perform a simple action.

In a custom solution, **I create** a pleasant and clean interface:
* **Only the buttons you need:** Exactly the functions your business process requires.
* **No visual clutter:** The manager sees only what leads to a sale.
* **Next.js 15+ Speed:** The interface responds instantly (**<0.6 sec**). In cloud systems, waiting 3-4 seconds for a card to load collectively steals up to **400–500 work hours per year** from a team of 20.

## 3. Technology Serving Small Business

**I use** the same tech stack as industry leaders, but I package it into a lightweight solution:
* **Next.js and Python:** Flexibility to add new features without monthly surcharges.
* **PostgreSQL:** A reliable database with optimal indexing — your data is always at your fingertips.
* **Docker & Terraform:** Your system is mobile. It can be moved from a $10 cloud server to your own office server in 15 minutes.

## 4. ROI and Scalability

For a small company, implementing a basic custom CRM is the shortest path to a return on investment. Due to the complete absence of "per-head" payments and minimal server costs, the system fully pays for its development within **6–9 months**.

**It is important to understand: your own system is not a "frozen" product that cannot be changed. On the contrary, it is a flexible foundation that you can improve and supplement with necessary functionality at any time, specifically for the current tasks of your business. Unlike closed SaaS platforms, here you are not limited by someone else's updates — you decide for yourself when and what tools to add as the company expands.**

## Conclusion

A custom CRM for small business is an opportunity to get an Enterprise-level tool but without the noise and perpetual payments. It is your foundation for growth that won't become more expensive when your team grows from 20 to 50 people.
